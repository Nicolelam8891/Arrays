How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far? 
Arrays was easy to comprehend at first until I got to the methods. I think utilizing Mozilla was confusing at first; however, after referring back to it a couple of times, I am more comfortable using it and this will not be a great resource to utilize! I learned a lot from this website and am confident to use it moving foward. I believe with more pratice, I will get better at Arrays and build on it. I am starting to pay attention and making sure I use technical terms and explain myself well. I am printing all of the assignments and writing down and highlighting my notes directly on there so if I ever have questions about Arrays, I can easily find the lesson and the notes in my binder. Although Arrays was difficult towards the middle to end, it has been my favorite lesson so far and I really enjoyed tackling the lesson!

Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
 I will prob need to practice more with the methods and remember the steps for Arrays. I am having a hard time memorizing what to do next but once I remember and figure it out with my notes, I can get going and understanding what is going on.

What questions do you have about Arrays?
 When would we use Arrays? Is it more for entering data?
